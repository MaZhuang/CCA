This folder contains implementations of appgrad and stochastic appgrad algorithm for CCA on mnist dataset (will generate exactly the same plots as in the paper)

For appgrad, run mnist.m file in mnist_gd folder  (it will take a long time since here we are focusing on getting a CCA subspace thatâ€™s almost as good as the true CCA direction instead of catch a fast and approximately good subspace )

For stochastic appeared, run formal_mnist.m file in mnist_sgd folder

For more details of the algorithm, refer to http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08170v1.pdf
